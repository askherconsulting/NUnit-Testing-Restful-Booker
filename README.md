# TestingWithNUnit
Repo for Testing with NUnit 

Note a lot of the code for this course has been adapted directly from Brendan Connelly's excellent TAU course: https://testautomationu.applitools.com/nunit-tutorial/

I have modified specific tests to assist with my learning, but this is an excellent repo for sample NUnit tests for me to utilise in future.

`Note: Some Example Tests are intentionally failing or inconclusive to demonstrate nUnit functionality`
