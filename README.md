# TestingWithNUnit
Repo for Testing with NUnit 

Note a lot of the code for this course has been adapted directly from Brendan Connelly's excellent TAU course: https://testautomationu.applitools.com/nunit-tutorial/

I have modified specific tests to assist with my learning, but this is an excellent repo for sample NUnit tests for me to utilise in future.

`Note: Some Example Tests are intentionally failing or inconclusive to demonstrate nUnit functionality`

TODO

work out why testingWithNUnit.BookerDataDriverTests(1) has no source available and cannot be deleted

understand why debug mode generates an element not found exception

understand why the tests are taking so long to execute
